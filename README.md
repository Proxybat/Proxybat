## About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Proxybat
- 👀 I’m interested in... video games, art, music, & coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... GDscript, Python, & Git.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate... on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me... nothing so far!

## Hi
Hi I'm fairly new to code, I made a github for 2 reasons.

1. To make troubleshooting with others easier.
2. Possibly help others with their repos.
3. Share code/projects to others.
4. Hopefully get help from others.

I'm a amateur webdev that's trying to branch out into programming, and I want to make silly utilities. <br>
This stuff is more of an interest of mine but I hope to make it into a career I'll enjoy.
